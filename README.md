# NodeImageToBase64

This is a demo of a Node server that serves an image as a base64 string.

The Angular part simply displays the image fetched from the server.

# Installation

## Server only

1. `cd server`

1. `npm i`

## Angular demo

1. `npm i`

# Server

See `server/index.js` for the server code. It serves a demo image as base64.

To run the server:

1. `cd server`

1. `node .`

OR

1. `npm start_server`


# Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.18.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server (it will start the Node server and the Angular dev server). 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the Angular source files.
